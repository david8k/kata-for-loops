# Basic Programming Kata

## Introduction

This kata is intended to be coded in an iterative way. Follow each requirement by their own solely taking into account previous requirements. **Not** future ones.

As a prerequisite. The user that makes this Kata is expected to have at least slim knowledge about Java. To relief knowledge about testing, all the tests will be commented out of the code and can be added as soon as the requirements allow it.

## How to do this Kata

Get use to the code first. Run the tests by doing:

```./gradlew test```

If the tests are green, you can proceed to the first requirement.

### Doing the requirements

For each requirement it is really important that you look for the test's prefix `requirement_X` where X is the number of the requirement that you are intending to solve.

After you've identified that, delete the line `@skip` from those tests and run the tests by using `./gradlew test`.

You will notice that some tests are failing. It is your job to fix them, normally. The tests will pass again if the requirement is fully completed.

**Get to the next requirement if and only if all the tests are green**
